    <p class="text-center">As this quote may suggest, this is the first full stack web application I have deployed.
        Programmed in Python (Django), stored in PostgreSQL, styled in Bootstrap, and deployed on Heroku, this website currently
        represents the culmination of my extracurricular efforts to teach myself web development. As such, it will more than
        likely be added to and refactored over time as my skills and understanding improve.</p>
        <br>
      <p class="text-center">
          The content of the website is maintained mostly for my personal use. I quite enjoyed the technical or creative writing
          I was assigned throughout college, and as such the blog section may be a nice way to research and document some cool stuff
          I decide to write about from time to time. The recipe section,
          while not quite original, is simply for storing and referencing my personal creations, and being able to send them to family
          and friends when they ask. Lastly, the best way to learn something is to teach it, likewise the
          programming section may include programming subjects I have found enough interest or value in to exercise my creative writing
          ability on technical topics I am attempting to teach myself.
